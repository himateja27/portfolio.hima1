      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Vankayalapati Hima Teja </strong>, a passionate
        Electronics and Communication Engineering student based in Tirupati,
        India. I specialize in full-stack web development and , blending
        software to build practical, real-world solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Golang, and
        MySQL, I enjoy creating seamless user experiences and robust backend
        systems. My recent projects include a full-stack banking system and a
        personal portfolio site, both of which showcase my ability to integrate
        APIs, troubleshoot deployment issues, and deliver polished results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond coding, I'm driven by curiosity and a growth mindset. I love
        exploring new technologies, refining my resume for tech roles, and
        building projects that reflect both creativity and technical depth. If
        you're looking for someone who's proactive, resourceful, and always
        eager to learnâ€”I'm your Hima Teja.

        <h3>Banking System</h3>
        <p>Full-stack banking app with Flask backend and API integration.</p>
        <p>
          Successfully built and tested a scalable banking system with real-time
          data flow between frontend and backend. Demonstrated strong debugging
          skills and full-stack integration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The backend is modular and API-driven, tested with Postman and
          integrated using JavaScript fetch(). Refactored from procedural to
          class-based Python for maintainability, and structured for deployment
          on platforms like Render.
